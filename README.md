<h2>Other Details</h2>

This was designed because my other homemade Arduboy had broken and I needed a new one, other designs had a lot of other stuff or different parts so I opted to make my own, through trial and error I was able to reach Mk3 (Mk1 and Mk2 failed unfortunately). The Battery does receive 4.2v so I highly recommend a battery with a circuit protection (I don't think it causes any issues with it though)

I am not a professional PCB designer nor am I fully aware of electronics, I have common knowledge collected over a long time so if it breaks for you sorry.

**Note** *Keep your eyes peeled for a Mk4, it’ll be credit card sized and for the more advanced users to make, I am majorly debugging the PCB so it’ll be a while but I hope to get something out either this year or half way through next year*
